## 📖 Overview  

This project was built as my **first full-stack web development project**, designed to practice integrating frontend, backend, and database layers into a seamless web app.  

The goal was to:  
- Build a **responsive and intuitive UI** for managing notes.  
- Connect the **frontend and backend** effectively.  
- Practice **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with MongoDB.  
- Deploy the full-stack app using modern hosting platforms.

- ✏️ **Update Notes** – edit existing notes in real time.  
- 🗑️ **Delete Notes** – remove notes when no longer needed.  
- 💾 **Database Integration** – notes are stored securely in MongoDB.  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- ⚡ **RESTful API** – backend operations are fast and efficient.
